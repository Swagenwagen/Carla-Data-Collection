# Carla-Data-Collection

## Setting up the CARLA simulator and python api:
#### - Install CARLA from the github repo
#### - Extract it somewhere you can access easily
#### - Download and set up a python 3.8 environment (I used anaconda for this)
#### - Use pip to install the CARLA python package onto said environment
#### - In your IDE of choice, set the interpreter to your python 3.8 environment

## Running CARLA
#### - In a command line, change your directory to where your CARLA install is
#### - Then, run the program. Depending on your computer's hardware, you may need to run lower settings or directx 11. Personally, I enable low settings and directx 11
#### using the command CarlaUE4 -dx11 -low

## Setting up this script
#### - Clone the repository in the same folder as where your CARLA install is
#### - Run CARLA
#### - Ensure your interpreter is set correctly in your IDE/text editor of choice
#### - Run the script simultaneously
